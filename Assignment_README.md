In this Repository, as it is my first attempt to submit anything on GitHub, there should be one Excel File containing multiple worksheets reflecting my attempt at addressing the "Excel Kick Starter" homework.

There should also be a "Word Document" containing my "Report".  I am attemptoing to copy the report here as well. The only thing that wasn't copied from the Word Document to this ReadMe.MD are copies of the PivotTable Charts that I copied from the XLSX file.


Rutgers Data Science BootCamp
Homework # 1 – Excel Kick Starter Report
By:  Ali Daneshmand

Note:  I’m not sure how much depth I should delve into in regard to the “Learning” or “Meaning” based on the “Visualization” of the existing data.

Note:  Admittedly, I may have made some human error in the cleaning of the data as it pertained to filtering our Category / Subcategory into separate Columns, which obviously color my analysis.

  
 
1.	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?

Conclusion #1:  Based on the data visualized above, it looks like the “Theater” has the most successful launches.

Conclusion #2:  Based on the data visualized above, amongst all the Theater categories, Musical Theater is the most successful.

Conclusion # 3:  Based on the data visualized above, May through July are the most active months


2.	What are some limitations of this dataset?

a.	It would be convenient if the “Blurbs” about each activity is more standardized in formatting, allowing for easier searchability of Blurb Content.
b.	Definitions and Metadata
c.	Source of Funding


3.	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Table: 			$$ Pledged, State of Event, Category, Sub Category
Graph Suggestion:		$$ Pledged vs State of Event
				$$ Pledged vs Category
				$$ Pledged vs Sub Category
				State of Event vs Category
				State of Event vs Sub Category
